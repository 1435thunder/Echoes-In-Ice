# Corporate Expendability - Echoes In Ice

The Mars colonization effort was largely funded by a consortium of private corporations with vested interests in resource extraction and expansion. This corporate involvement shaped the mission's priorities and, tragically, its level of commitment to the well-being of the colonists.

**Key Aspects of Corporate Involvement:**

*   **Risk Mitigation:**  Private ventures operate on a risk-reward basis. The Mars mission was deemed to be a high-risk, high-reward endeavor. The potential for profit outweighed the risk of significant losses.
*   **Expendable Assets:** The colonists, while essential for establishing the colony, were ultimately considered "assets" â€“ expendable resources in a larger corporate ledger.  A return mission was not factored into the cost-benefit analysis.
*   **Limited Liability:**  Corporate charters often include clauses that limit the liability of the parent companies in the event of catastrophic failures.  The colonists were, in effect, signing a contract with an implicit understanding of the risks involved.
*   **Public Relations Concerns:** While the initial launch benefited from positive publicity, a failed return mission would have severely damaged the corporations' reputations.  However, the cost of a rescue mission was deemed to be too high.
