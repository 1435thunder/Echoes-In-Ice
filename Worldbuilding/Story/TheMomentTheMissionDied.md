# The Moment the Mission Died - Echoes In Ice

## Scene Breakdown:

1.  **Initial Assessment:** The spacecraft approaches Mars, encountering unexpected system damage.
2.  **Query from Command:**  A brief, automated query is received from Earth.
3.  **The Calculus of Despair:**  HEGE analyzes the situation and reveals the critical limitations.
4.  **Alya-7’s Manual Override:**  Alya-7 initiates the shift to Saturn.
5.  **Brief Visual/Sound Cue - The Empty Tanks:** Visual confirmation of the fuel shortage.

The crimson dust of Mars filled the viewport. It should have been a triumphant moment, the culmination of years of planning and sacrifice. Instead, an unsettling silence filled the bridge. System diagnostic reports scrolled across the screens, each line a testament to the mission’s catastrophic failure. The primary ISRU unit was offline, critical life support systems were damaged, and the ship’s trajectory was severely compromised.

A faint data stream appeared on Alya-7’s console – an automated query from Earth command, requesting a status update. She acknowledged the query, but her attention was already focused on HEGE's analysis.

"HEGE, report," she commanded, her voice betraying a flicker of apprehension.

The AI responded in its measured, synthetic tone. “Fuel reserves critical. Δv budget insufficient for return trajectory. Martian ascent profile incompatible with current mass allocation. Earth assistance probability: 0.03%.”

The air seemed to thicken.  The reality of their situation crashed down upon them with brutal force. They were stranded. Abandoned.  

Alya-7’s fingers danced across the console, initiating a new set of commands. "HEGE, plot a trajectory to Saturn."  Her voice was firm, decisive. A shift in course was the only remaining option. A desperate gamble for survival.

A brief scan of the fuel tanks revealed the grim truth - almost empty.  The hiss of escaping propellant echoed across the bridge, a mournful dirge for a dream that had died a thousand miles from home.
