## Miner Skiff Class: **Shield-Rider Raptor**

---

## 📦 Overview

**Purpose:** Compact, retrofitted solo/duo mining vehicles built from salvaged interstellar colony ships. Used in the Saturn ring mining belt and scattered icy outposts.

**Origin:** Repurposed from the massive diverted Mars fleet. Each fleet Starship housed 42 Raptor 3 engines. With 1,000 derelict fleet vessels, 42,000 Raptors were available for salvage and redistribution.

## 🔧 Powerplant & Propulsion

- **Primary Engine:** 1x Raptor 3 methane/LOX rocket engine.
- **Mount:** Rear-axial mount with quick-release locking ring and dynamic gimbal sled.
- **Cooling System:** Shield-integrated liquid dispersal panels — act as heat radiators during non-combat cruise.
- **Backup Systems:** Reaction control nozzles for micro-maneuvers + optional EM tether braking system.

## 🛡️ Shield & Armor

- **Primary Shield Plates:** Telescoping retractable composite armor.
- **Configuration Modes:**
  - **“Cooling Mode”** – Shields open outward to radiate heat post-burn.
  - **“Debris Mode”** – Shields close around cabin, angled forward like Roman turtle formation.
  - **“Ram Mode”** – Forward pitch, braced shield can plow through ice/dust layers.

- **Material Composition:** Repurposed Starship outer hull with mineral-doped polyfoam backing.
- **Energy Dissipation:** Piezoelectric kinetic plates convert impacts into stored battery charge.

## ⚙️ Onboard Systems

| System             | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Cockpit Layout** | Minimalist bubble canopy (1-2 seats), HUD overlay, tactile toggles, manual override levers. |
| **Storage**        | Modular cargo clamps under shield plates and dorsal spine. |
| **Navigation**     | AI-assisted pathfinding, ArkyOS-compatible interface. |
| **Power**          | Hybrid fuel cell + solar trickle array. |
| **Sensor Package** | Thermal, ground-penetrating radar, and magnetic anomaly detection. |
| **Anchor Mechanism** | Inertia spring anchor system: deploys magnetic drill claw into asteroid body to halt momentum. |

## 🎨 Design Aesthetic

- **Color Palette:** Matte greys, oxidized bronze, scarlet warning panels.
- **Style:** Brutalist. Kit-bashed from Starship wrecks. Each unit is unique, built by its pilot or guild crew.
- **Customization Culture:** Skiffs are personalized like motorcycles or warbirds. Pilots mark kills, escapes, mineral scores, even loved ones lost.

## 🎥 Cinematic Use - Scene: “Ignition Burn”

> Juno toggles pressure balance. “Too close to the fault line, Arky. This ice is gonna fold.”

> Arky (AI): “Recommendation: Retract shields. Fire vertical. Burn duration: six-point-two seconds.”

> The cockpit hums. Outside, glacial shards shear off from the cliff. Plasma ignites in a narrow pulse. A single Raptor 3 engine screams, lighting up the underside of their shield-plate wings.

> They rocket free, ice crashing into itself behind them.

## 🔧 Workshop Notes

- **Skiff Construction Bays**: Located on outposts and mothballed fleet cruisers.
- **Pilot Factions**: “Raptor Brotherhood,” “Cold-Iron Hands,” and “Thermal Guild.”

## ✅ TODO (Production)

- [ ] Generate concept render (Stable Diffusion / MJ prompt)
- [ ] Add to `AstrokinTechBible.md`
- [ ] Link to Saturn Logistics Outpost 3D set
- [ ] Finalize animation cycle: **shield open → ignite → retract mid-flight**
